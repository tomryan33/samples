find and replace (such as replace `x` with `99`), JavaScript style functions, and if-then-else statements.  The main
purpose of this program is in the building of expressions which then can be calculated and returns a result.  An
expression can be as simple as `5 + 10` which returns `15`, or a bit more complex such as `_if 5 + 10 == 15 _then
50 _else 100` which would return `50`.
